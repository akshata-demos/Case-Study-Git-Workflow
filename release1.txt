In software development, DevOps release management is the process of automating,
coordinating, and controlling the release of software updates.
It uses continuous integration and delivery (CI/CD) to deliver new features and fixes
reliably and efficiently. This involves planning, building, testing, and deploying releases
in an automated pipeline to increase reliability, speed up time to market,
and improve collaboration between development and operations teams.
